**Exercise 1: Shopping List (Lists)**
You are going shopping and want to create a list to keep track of the items you need to buy. Create a Python list called `shopping_list` and add at least five items to it.

**Exercise 2: User Information (Dictionaries)**
Imagine you are building a user registration system. Create a Python dictionary called `user_info` to store information about a user. Include keys such as 'username', 'email', and 'age'. Populate the dictionary with sample data.

**Exercise 3: Days of the Week (Tuples)**
Create a Python tuple called `days_of_week` to store the names of the days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.). Attempt to modify the tuple by adding or removing elements, and explain why it works or doesn't work.

**Exercise 4: Unique Numbers (Sets)**
You want to create a set of unique numbers. Start with an empty set called `unique_numbers` and add a few numbers to it. Ensure that there are no duplicates in the set.

**Exercise 5: Boolean Logic (Booleans)**
Create two boolean variables, `is_student` and `is_teacher`, and assign them values based on a person's role. Then use these variables to answer questions like, "Is the person a student?" or "Is the person a teacher?"

**Exercise 6: Grocery List (Lists and Dictionaries)**
Create a Python list called `grocery_items`, and for each item, create a dictionary that includes 'name', 'quantity', and 'price'. For example, you might have an item like {'name': 'apples', 'quantity': 5, 'price': 1.99}. Add several grocery items to the list.

**Exercise 7: Weather Forecast (Dictionaries and Nested Data)**
Imagine you're building a weather app. Create a dictionary called `weather_forecast` that includes data for the current weather, such as 'temperature', 'conditions', and 'wind_speed'. Use nested dictionaries to store data for the next few days. 

**Exercise 8: Favorite Colors (Sets)**
Create two sets, `set1` and `set2`, containing your favorite colors. Find the intersection of the two sets (the colors that are your favorites in both sets) and create a new set with the shared favorites.

**Exercise 9: User Preferences (Dictionaries)**
Create a dictionary called `user_preferences` to store user settings. Include settings like 'theme_color', 'notifications', and 'font_size'. Modify some of these settings to simulate a user changing their preferences.

**Exercise 10: User Status (Booleans)**
Simulate a user's online status by using a boolean variable, `is_online`. When the user logs in or out, update the boolean accordingly.
