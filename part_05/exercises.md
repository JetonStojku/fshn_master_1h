### Exercise 1
Write a Python function to check whether a number is perfect or not.
According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that 
is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive 
divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently,
a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).
```
Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6.
The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.
```

### Exercise 2
Write a Python function that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
Note : Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal.
```
Sample Pascal's triangle :
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
1 5 10 10 5 1
1 6 15 20 15 6 1
Pascal's triangle Each number is the two numbers above it added together
```

### Exercise 3
Build a function that takes two numbers from the user and returns the multiplication table in the following format:
```
Example: 3, 4

|   |1  |2  |3  |4  |
|1  |1  |2  |3  |4  |
|2  |2  |4  |6  |8  |
|3  |3  |6  |9  |12 |
```

### Exercise 3
Using the filter function, return the elements of a list that are truthy.

### Exercise 4
Using the filter function returns the elements of a list that are divisible by 7.

### Exercise 5
Using the filter function returns the elements of a list that, when divided by 7, have a remainder of 1.

### Exercise 6
Build a class that stores the following student data:
Name, surname, major, year, existing year subjects, subjects taken with their grades, and remaining subjects

### Exercise 7
Build a class that stores all the elements of a restaurant menu, ingredients, and the quantity of ingredients for each portion

### Exercise 8
Build a class to store information about the countries of the world, capital, population, and area
