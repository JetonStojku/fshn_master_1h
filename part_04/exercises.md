### Exercise 1
Build a function that takes a list as a parameter and returns a tuple with 2 values:
- The first value is the quantity of odd numbers
- The second value is the quantity of even numbers

### Exercise 2
Build a function that takes the prices of products in a store as a list parameter and returns the product with the highest price.

### Exercise 3
Build a function that takes two lists of unequal lengths, l1 and l2, as parameters and returns a list whose elements are the sums of the elements of lists l1 and l2 up to the length of the shorter list.
Example:
```python
l1 = [1, 2, 3, 10]
l2 = [4, 5, 6]
# Answer:
# l = [5, 7, 9]
```

### Exercise 4
Build a function that takes two lists of unequal lengths, l1 and l2, as parameters and returns a list whose elements are the sums of the elements of lists l1 and l2 up to the length of the shorter list, and continues with the elements of the longer list.
Example:
```python
l1 = [1, 2, 3, 10, 20]
l2 = [4, 5, 6]
# Answer:
# l = [5, 7, 9, 10, 20]
```
